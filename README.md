Use this Google Fusion Tables template if you wish to:
- Create a point map with a textual legend (such as Preschool, Pre-K, Homecare), rather than a numeric legend (such as 0-100). If you only need a numeric legend, then use the Google Fusion Tables built-in Automatic Legend feature, which works for point maps (using buckets) or polygon maps (using buckets or gradients), but only if data is numerical. See more at https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/185991

OR

- Create a search-and-filter point map, where you can turn variables on/off (using either textual or numeric data)

Basic steps:

1) Make your own copy of this template: either Fork to your own GitHub account, or Clone in Desktop, or Download a ZIP compressed version to your desktop.

2) Modify two files, following instructions in the code comments:
- index.html
- maps_lib.js (located inside the js folder)

3) Host everything on the web (such as a GitHub repository gh-pages branch)
